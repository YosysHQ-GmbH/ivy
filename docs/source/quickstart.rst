Getting Started
===============


Installation
------------

IVY is part of the `Tabby CAD Suite`_, which also contains all required dependencies.

Currently IVY requires Tabby CAD for the IVY language support.
This section will be extended when it becomes possible to use IVY's tooling with an alternative way of specifying invariants that is compatible with the `OSS CAD Suite`_.
