InVariants with Yosys (IVY) Documentation
=========================================

IVY consists of SystemVerilog langage extensions for describing (inductive) invariants of SystemVerilog designs, for strengthening proofs of SVA properties, and for describing strategies for proving those invariants and SVA properties together with tooling that can formally prove invariants and SVA properties to be correct and can help manage invariants and keep track of which are proven and which aren't.
